# Flickering Connections for 3DS
## Introduction
In 2024, I created an unfinished demo of a platformer game, Flickering Connections, in the Unity game engine,  
which contains basic platformer mechanics and player customization features. This project is meant  
to bring that experience to the Nintendo 3DS via LÖVE Potion, a Lua-based tool.
> [!NOTE]
> This is still a work in progress project! As of 6/1/2025, this project currently does nothing except show different colors on the top and bottom screen, serving as basic setup for when I start work on the actual conversion of Flickering Connections to a Lua-based 3DS game. More is coming soon!!
## How to use
### On 3DS Hardware
[Coming soon -- will update once I have had the chance to test on real hardware.]
### Emulation
This game is built using LÖVE Potion, and thanks to the [nëst](https://github.com/lovebrew/nest) lib, can be  
simulated inside of LÖVE. If you're looking to simulate this on your computer,  
follow these steps:
* Download the `game` folder from this repository.
* Place the `game` folder in an easy-to-access place (for example, Desktop)  
  * On Windows:
    * [Coming soon]
  * On MacOS:
    * Open Terminal
    * Type the following:
      ```
      cd Desktop
      ```
      followed by
      ```
      open -n -a love "game"
      ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > In order for this to work, you must have LÖVE installed. It can be found [here](https://love2d.org/#download).
